            <h4>Who I Am</h4>
                <p>
                    I am a computer science student attending North Carolina A&T State University. 
                    I am a programmer, a creative, a professional stress baker, and the oldest in a 
                    set of twins. I am the founder of Earthbound, a greentech startup company.
                </p>
            <h4>What I am Passionate About</h4>
                <p>
                    I want to inspire people to step outside of the box and not conform to or be pressured by
                    stereotypes. I am passionate about combining creativity and art with technology to solve 
                    the world's problems. I want to explore that intersection of art and technology throughout 
                    my career. Coding aside, I want to give back to my community as much as I can. Food insecuirty,
                    homelessness, racial inequality, and climate change are problems that I am particualy interested
                    in solving.
                </p>
            <h4>Areas of Technology/ Opportunities I am Interested In</h4>
                <p>
                    I am interested in internship opportunities in software engineering, frontend development, web 
                    development, and UX/UI design. Artificial intellegence is another area of technology that I am
                    facinated with. I am also interested in opportunities involving entrepenuership, 
                    leadership devleopment, and mentorship. I have experience with Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, 
                    Java, Figma, and Android Studio.
                </p>
            <h4>Plans After College</h4>
                <p>
                    I plan to pursue a Master's of Science in Computer Science or Software Engineering after graduating
                    undergrad. After graduate school, I want to spend time building my startup. I want to gain more experience
                    in the software engineering industry as well.
                </p>
            <h4>Future Plans for this Website</h4>
                <P>
                    I will update this website with anymore projects that I develop in the future. I will also add more graphics as
                    I become more advanced in web development. I also plan to make this website more responsive. I will periodically fix
                    bugs as I notice them.
                </P>
            <h4>What's The Deal with the Space Background?</h4>
                <p>
                    Fun fact: I love astronomy. <br> Seriously though, when I think of space, I think about the concept of infinity. Anything
                    can happen in space. There are things out there that exist but aren't discovered yet. Paradoxes exist in space. I apply that 
                    logic to myself and the way I think. I try to look outside the box and solve problems in ways that people haven't thought about.
                    I am methodical and efficent in the way I strategize and complete my tasks, but my final products always have a creative spin
                    to them.
                </p>
