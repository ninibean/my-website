# my-website
Welcome, all!

Here is the repository for my portfolio website that I am building! It is not live yet!
I coded this on Visual Studio Code using HTML and CSS! I also plan on adding JavaScript in the future! There's also a little bit of bootstrap in there.

My website has:
1. A navagation bar (with "home", "blog", "projects", and "about" pages)
2. A footer
3. Hyperlinks to external websites

TODO:
1. Create resume timeline on website
2. Add most recent projects to the project page
2. Add social media badges
