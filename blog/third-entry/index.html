                I was trying to learn how to use the more advanced features of Bootstrap today. It's really hard haha. I keep seeing templates of
                things, but no code or documentation. Maybe I'll keep playing around with CSS first. I eventually want my homepage to be... much
                better than it is now. I also want to find a terminal script or console script that will greet people when they open the page. I 
                need to develop a color scheme as well. I also think I am going to actually start titling my entries. Maybe I should make a tag to 
                close out my entires.
            </p>

                I've been looking into website hosting, and GitHub looks like it would be the best choice for me. It looks familiar and it's 
                <b>FREE.</b> They also offer an option to make a custon URL. I am not sure it costs extra to do that though.
            </p>
            <p>
                For my Blog page, I want a thumbnail grid type thingy. I think it will look more modern and users will be able to access whatever entry
                they want much easier.
            </p>
            <p>
                My Projects Page will have a thumbnail setup. Definitely. I am not sure if I want to include my github link there or just leave it in 
                the Contact page.
            </p>
            <p>
                For my Contacts page, I want to have icons next to my social media. I also am going to delete the link to my <i>fake</i> email. I just 
                wanted to see how the mailto function worked. It's really cool honesty! Maybe when I set up a public email account, I'll add the feature
                back. <b>REMINDER: Take address section of the page!!!</b>
            </p>

                Oh well. Problems for futrue Niara.
